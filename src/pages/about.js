                    Dan &amp; Balzy &nbsp;welcome you with open arms to Hooker
                    &amp; Eight - Gloucester’s only independent sit-down pizza
                    joint.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Dan and Balz are childhood school friends who played local
                    youth rugby together for many years. It was one cold
                    Christmas night at the Old Elm in Churchdown in 2014 where a
                    very important was asked….”Why isn’t there a proper deece
                    pizza place in Gloucester (and other than the pubs) why ‘ent
                    there deece places to go to before the rugby!!”
                </p>
                <p>
                    It was one that couldn’t be answered for a few years and
                    almost remained a drunken pipe-dream so often talked about
                    but never progressed. Balz was too busy playing
                    amongst&nbsp;the grass and Dan waiting&nbsp;for the snow to
                    fall!
                </p>
                <p>
                    4 years it remained a dream. Until 2018, when the building
                    49 Westgate Street became available and was snapped up by
                    our incredible landlords Anne + Toby Wooldridge, the owners
                    of locally famous Peppers Cafe.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A call was made. Did we have enough money to set up-
                    probably not? Have we had any experience running a business?
                    Absolutely not.
                </p>
                <p>Well, f**k it. You only live once. Let's give it a go!!</p>
                <p>
                    Other than the lack of money and experience the only other
                    problem was the site was the music shop SoundHouse and it
                    needed a lot of work to get ready.

                    99% of what you see in the restaurant has been-up cycled or
                    sourced second hand with most of the cosmetic work,
                    painting, sanding and woodwork being done by Dan, Balzy,
                    Toby, &nbsp;Balzy’s mum and very rarely, Balzy’s Dad. We
                    found many bargains online but we could not have done this
                    without the extra support from Anne and Toby.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hold tight Stu, Old Stu, Digz, Little Venn, Graeme, Nick
                    Cook and (add all other tradespeople for the professional
                    work we needed doing)
                </p>
                <p>
                    It took the best part of a year and genuine blood, sweat and
                    tears to get the restaurant ready for the city of Gloucester
                    to enjoy and on 11th October 2019, future Gloucester Captain
                    Lewis Ludlow, came in the evening to officially open Hooker
                    &amp; Eight. A homage to Gloucester rugby and a pizza joint
                    that caters to Gloucester tastes. We don't try to pretend to
                    be something we are not!
                </p>
                <p>
                    The result, we hope, is a chilled, warm&nbsp; and inviting
                    30 seater restaurant with top grade pizza and the best
                    eclectic beats blasted out all day.

                    Gloucester match days are extra special at the restaurant.
                    Everyone wearing their cherry &amp; white, proud and tall. A
                    buzz similar to the Shed - you will need to book in advance
                    on these days!!!
                </p>
                <p>

                    It is likely that always one of Dan and Balzy will be
                    working when you visit (quite often both if not out with the
                    Openside mobile pizza wagon) - we love chatting and getting
                    to know our supporters so please bend our ear when you come
                    in!
                </p>
                <p>Much love</p>
                <p>Dan &amp; Balzy</p>
